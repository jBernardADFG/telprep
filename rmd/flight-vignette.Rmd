This vignette will show you how the telprep package can be used to automatically process data from telemetry flights. The program is designed to read in raw txt files, filter out erroneous signals, determine the living status of fish, and create some pretty pictures. This tutorial highlights the general workflow of the program. For a finer scale description of the program functionalities, see the help files for the following functions: **read_flight_data**, **channels_merge**, **replace_date**, **combine_data**, **get_date_bins**, **rm_land_detects**, **get_best_detections**, **get_locations**, **flag_dead_fish**, **hmm_survival**, **and make_plot**.


### Program Workflow:

* Step 1 -- Read raw detection data into R
* Step 2 -- If channels or dates were misprogrammed, make corrections
* Step 3 -- Combine the raw data between receivers and across flights
* Step 4 -- Import geographic data
* Step 5 -- Remove false signals and determine the location of each fish during a set of detection periods
* Step 6 -- Determine the living status of the fish
* Step 7 -- Create some pretty pictures

### Step 1 -- Read raw detection data into R

Begin by sticking the raw txt files into a folder. Txt files from multiple flights can and should be included in the folder. When naming the txt files, the flight grouping, flight date, and the receiver location (belly/wing) should be included (eg: F1_1-26-19_Belly.TXT) as this information will be used later on. Find the directory of the folder (my example files are in "D:/Jordy/flight-data/") and store the coordinate reference systems of the txt files (the proj4string) in the variable *crs_in*. The function **read_flight_data** can now be used to read the raw data into R and store it in the variable *raw_data*:

```{r}
directory <- "D:/Jordy/flight-data/"
crs_in <- "+proj=longlat +datum=NAD83 +no_defs +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0"
raw_data <- read_flight_data(directory, crs_in)
```

Structurally, *raw_data* is a list of data.frames (there is one for each txt file in the folder). To see how these data.frames are ordered, run

```{r}
names(raw_data)
```

The contents of "tburb_f1_1-26-19-WING.TXT" are stored in the 2nd data.frame in the list.

### Step 2 -- If channels or dates were misprogrammed, make corrections

If a channel or date was misprogrammed, it needs to be corrected before the contents of *raw_data* can be combined into a single data.frame. 

##### Misprogrammed Channels

Suppose that channel 3 was misprogrammed as channel 10 in "tburb_f1_1-26-19-WING.TXT". To peek at the data run

```{r}
head(raw_data[[2]])
```

To replace channel 10 with channel 3, the following line of code is run:

```{r}
raw_data[[2]] <- channels_merge(raw_data[[2]], 10, 3)
head(raw_data[[2]])
```

##### Misprogrammed Dates

Suppose that a date was misprogrammed in the file "tburb_f5_10-17-19-WING.TXT". To peek at the data, run 

```{r}
head(raw_data[[16]])
```

If the correct flight date was "10/17/19", the following line of code will make the correction:

```{r}
raw_data[[16]] <- replace_date(raw_data[[16]], new_date ="10/17/19") 
head(raw_data[[16]])
```

```{r include=FALSE}
raw_data[[18]] <- replace_date(raw_data[[18]], new_date ="10/7/19") 
```


### Step 3 -- Combine the raw data between receivers and across flights

The function **combine_data** combines all of the data stored in *raw_data* into a single data.frame. 

An argument (*source_vec*) is provided so that the source of each txt file can be specified. The argument can, for instance, be used to specify whether a receiver was located on the belly or the wing of the aircraft. Because 26 txt files were contained in the example folder, a vector of length 26 is used to encode this information:

```{r}
names(raw_data)
source_vec <- c(rep(c("belly","wing"), 10), rep(c("wing","belly"),2), c("belly","wing"))
source_vec
```

Now that the source of the data has been specified, the function **combine_data** can be used to combine the contents of *raw_data*:

```{r}
all_data <- combine_data(raw_data, source_vec)
head(all_data)
```



### Step 4: Import geographic data

In order to use the telprep package, a SpatialLinesDataFrame representation of the river system must be imported into R. The following lines of code can be used to import a shapefile (named example.shp) as a SpatialLinesDataFrame object using the **readOGR** function from the rgdal package:

```{r warning=FALSE}
setwd("D:/Jordy/telprep/telprep/data/sf")
sldf <- rgdal::readOGR("example.shp")
```

The coordinate reference system of the geographic data must match that of the detection data. If the coordinate reference systems do not match, the following line of code will convert the coordinate reference system of the geographic data to that of the detection data. 

```{r}
sldf <- sp::spTransform(sldf, attr(all_data, "crs"))
```


### Step 5: Remove false signals and determine the location of each fish during a set of detection periods

The riverdist package is used internally for calculations related to river proximity. To use the functionality of this package, *sldf* (from Step 4) must be converted into a river_network object. The riverdist function *line2network* can be used to make the conversion (the user is referred to the riverdist package for help).

```{r}
river_net <- riverdist::line2network(sp=sldf, tolerance = 500)
```

The function **rm_land_detects** can be used to discard the detections that occurred away from the river system. To remove the detections that occurred more than 500 m away from a river channel and store the data in a variable called *river_detects*, the following line of code is run:

```{r}
river_detects <- rm_land_detects(all_data, river_net, dist_thresh = 500)
```

The function **get_best_locations** can be used to determine the best location for each fish in each detection period. In short, the best location is considered to be the location where the highest power detection occurred during each flight period. The *date_bins* argument of the **get_best_locations** function specifies the start and end dates of the detection periods. These dates can be found and formatted using the **get_date_bins** function:

```{r}
names(raw_data)
flight_group <- c(1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,4,5,5,5,5,6,6,7,7,7,7,8,8)
date_bins <- get_date_bins(raw_data, flight_group)
date_bins
```

After the detection periods have been specified, the function **get_best_locations** can be used to determine the locations the fish:

```{r echo = T, results = 'hide'}
best_locations <- get_best_locations(river_detects, date_bins =  date_bins, bin_by=NA, n_thresh = 5, dist_max = 5000, remove_flagged = F)
```

```{r}
head(best_locations$all_detects)
head(best_locations$best_detects)
```

*best_locations\$all_detects* adds some useful to *all_data*: *BestSignal* is the signal with the highest power in a detection period, *Dist* is the Euclidean distance (in km) between the detection location and the associated highest power detection, *FlightNum* is the detection period, and *Records* is number of times that a fish was detected in a detection period. *all_detects\$best_detects* contains the highest power detections only. These detections are flagged if there are fewer than *n_thresh* detections within a distance of *dist_max* km from the best detection during the detection period. The detection will also be flagged if a positive linear relationship exists between *Power* and *Dist* for all detections within *dist_max* km from the best signal in the detection period (i.e. the signal strength increases as the best detection is approached).

### Step 6 -- Determine the living status of the fish

Two functions (**flag_dead_fish** and **hmm_survival**) are provided to help determine the living status of fish. 

**flag_dead_fish** uses locational information to determine which fish have expired. If a fish moves less than *dist_thresh* km for all consecutive detection periods following a detection, the fish will be flagged as dead. The following lines of code will flag for dead fish using this approach: 

```{r}
best_detects <- best_locations$best_detects
head(best_detects)
best_detects <- best_detects[best_detects$flag==F,]
flagged_fish <- flag_dead_fish(best_detects, dist_thresh = 0.5)
head(flagged_fish)
```

**hmm_survival** operates similarly to **flag_dead_fish**; however, this function uses a more sophisticated method to determine the living status of the fish. Briefly, this function utilizes locational and mortality sensor related information to determine the most likely path of survival states (called the viterbi path) for each fish using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). A benefit to using a HMM based approach is that detection probabilities and survival rates are estimated using a statistical approach. These estimates are based on two key assumptions: 1) dead fish remain dead, and 2) dead fish do not move. A detailed description of the HMM can be found by running vignette("hmm") in the console. 

The following lines of code will fit the HMM to determine the living status of the fish:
```{r}
library(msm)
hmm_out <- hmm_survival(best_detects)
hmm_out$results
viterbi <- hmm_out$viterbi
head(viterbi)
```

In the column *viterbi\$Viterbi*, a value of 1 cooresponds to the event that the fish is alive whereas 2 cooresponds to the event that the fish has expired. 

#### Step 7 -- Create some pretty pictures

A plotting function (**make_plot**) is included in the telprep package. This function is designed to be used throughout the analysis. Example of how the function can be used are provided here:

```{r}
# plotting all detections
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
make_plot(sldf, all_data)

# real detections only
make_plot(sldf, best_detects)

# darken background
make_plot(sldf, best_detects, darken=2.5)

# change style of background
make_plot(sldf, best_detects, type="esri-topo")

# give each fish a unique color preserved through flights
par(mfrow=c(3,1))
make_plot(sldf, best_detects, col_by_fish=T, flight=1, darken=2.5)
make_plot(sldf, best_detects, col_by_fish=T, flight=2, darken=2.5)
make_plot(sldf, best_detects, col_by_fish=T, flight=3, darken=2.5)

# to plot the locations for a single fish
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
make_plot(sldf, best_detects, channel=10, tag_id=11, darken=2.5)

# to zoom in to a specified extent
extent <- c(x_min=466060, x_max=1174579, y_min=6835662, y_max=7499016)
make_plot(sldf, best_detects, extent, darken=2.5)

# plotting live and dead fish by flight period -- green fish have expired
par(mfrow=c(3,1))
make_plot(sldf, viterbi, type="bing", darken=2.5, viterbi=T, flight=1)
make_plot(sldf, viterbi, type="bing", darken=2.5, viterbi=T, flight=3)
make_plot(sldf, viterbi, type="bing", darken=2.5, viterbi=T, flight=5)
```

The function **make_gif** can be used to make dynamic plots (i.e. gifs). The user is referred to the function specific help files for more information; however, a few examples of the types of plots that can be created with these functions is provided below:

Plotting the most likely path of survival states for each fish -- live fish are red while green fish are dead:
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("S:/Jordy/telprep/telprep/gifs/viterbi/gif.gif")
```

Giving each fish a unique color that is preserved through flights:
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("S:/Jordy/telprep/telprep/gifs/byfish/gif.gif")
```

Finally the function **make_survival_plot** can be used to plot the number of expired fish (as determined by the viterbi path) by flight period:
```{r}
make_survival_plot(viterbi)
```
